# ZeROSMQ

ZeROSMQ is a Python library that implements ROS-like inter-process communication by using ["topics" and "nodes"](https://wiki.ros.org/Topics).

The library is installed by copying the relevant files (``zerosmq-master.py`` and ``zerosmq.py``) to your project folder. After that, follow the instructions shown in [the ReadTheDocs page](https://zerosmq.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for using the library.
